### About

A study aid that was designed in the mobile first mindset towards flash cards. Create a tool so that a user can easily review flash cards on their phone when they want.

### Technologies

I used Rails for the backend of my application and laid Angular on top.  My plan is to use Devise for user authorization and then OAuth so users can sign in via Twitter and Facebook.  I want to take a mobile first approach when designing the interface, since I envision that this app will be most useful as a study tool when people are on the move and have a few moments to spare.  

### Hurdles

Hardest part was figuring out how to lay Angular on top of Rails, spent the majority of my time dealing with that and has left my behind.  

### Installation

Please fork and clone down to your machine then study away.  Also, am open to suggestion, if you have any please submit a pull request.
